# A8.8 Conclusion
In this chapter we learned how to create HTTP servers using the Node.js JavaScript framework. We
implemented RESTful services with the Express library and practiced sending, retrieving, modifying, and
updating data using HTTP requests and responses. We then learned how to integrate React.js Web
applications to HTTP servers implementing a client server architecture. In the next chapter we will add
database support to the HTTP server so we can store data permanently.


# A8.9 Deliverables
As a deliverable, make sure you complete all the exercises in this chapter. For both the React and Node
repositories, all your work should be done in a branch called a8. When done, add, commit and push both
branches to their respective GitHub repositories. Deploy the new branches to Netlify and Render.js (or Heroku)
and confirm they integrate. Submit links to both your GitHub repositories as well as the Netlify and remote
Node URLs where the branches deployed. Here's an example on the steps:
Create a branch called a8
git checkout -b a8
 \# do all your work
Once you've completed all your work, add, commit and push your work to the remote repositories.
Add, commit and push the new branch
git add .
git commit -am "a8 REST fa22"
git push
